### AIB Online Banking API
I wanted to be able to access my bank account information from various sources, 
so I created this screenscraping API for AIB Online Banking. 

This version (v2) is the newer version of AIB Online banking (2015). To use the older
version, checkout branch (online-banking-v1).

### Implementation
Screenscraping a banking website requires very accurate imitation of a real 
user using a browser. User-Agents are important. The sequence of links you navigate 
to get to certain information is important. Every link has a one-time-only CSRF token 
attached that must be used only when clicking that link. 

To achieve this with the AIB Online Banking site, my strategy is to always bring the 
browsing session back to a "home" page and store that page HTML in a datastore 
(currently [MapDB](http://www.mapdb.org/), for no particular reason. You can replace this with your own 
implementation of a `StorageService` if you prefer - there's a sample Cassandra implementation
included too). As each API call comes through, I navigate from this known state to the pages required and then 
back to the home page. This makes some API calls a bit slower than you would desire, but 
it's easier than trying to maintain a state engine that knows where you are and how to get 
the desired page from there all the time. 

### Authentication
Once you interact with the site initially it assigns a `JSESSIONID` cookie that must be 
maintained for the rest of the session. I store this in the datastore with the page contents, 
and create a completely independent UUID Session ID for the API to use. This keeps your actual 
session ID secret which is good for security reasons. 

The API Session ID is returned from the first API call `/v2/login/registration` and must be sent 
as a query string parameter to all subsequent API calls. E.g.

```
POST /v2/login/pac?sessionId=517215a0-8c6a-11e3-97ac-001422f0bc99
```

### API
All API endpoints accept Form Encoded data and return JSON.

#### Transfer between your own accounts
This is fairly experimental still - as there's a need for a digit of the PIN the first
time you transfer in a session, I need all the PIN digits. Alternatively I could 
turn this into a two-step API call like the login...

| method | path                    					  				 |
|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| POST   | /v2/accounts/{accountNameFrom}/transferTo/{accountNameTo} |

##### Payload

| name  	| description             							                 | example value |
|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| narrativeFrom  | The description to appear on the source account statement. Will be truncated to 12 chars.   | "From me"  |
| narrativeTo | The description to appear on the destination account statement. Will be truncated to 18 chars. | "To you"  |
| pinDigits | All your PIN Digits as a 5-digit number. This isn't the best idea! | 12345         |
| amount | The amount to transfer 												 | 50.00 		 |

##### Example

```bash
$ curl -d "narrativeFrom=From me&narrativeTo=to you&amount=20&pinDigits=12345" \
		$API_BASE/v2/accounts/CURRENT-123/transferTo/SAVINGS-234?sessionId=517215a0-8c6a-11e3-97ac-001422f0bc99
```

```json

```

##### Properties

None

#### Logging Out

| method | path                    |
|--------|-------------------------|
| GET    | /v2/logout              |

##### Payload

None

##### Example

```bash
$ curl $API_BASE/v2/logout?sessionId=517215a0-8c6a-11e3-97ac-001422f0bc99
